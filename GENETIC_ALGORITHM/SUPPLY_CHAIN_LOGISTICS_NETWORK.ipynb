        "Roulette wheel selection is a probabilistic method used in genetic algorithms to choose individuals for reproduction based on their fitness. Each individual is assigned a slice of a virtual roulette wheel proportional to its fitness value â€” the higher the fitness, the larger the slice. During selection, the wheel is \"spun\" and individuals are picked randomly, but with a bias toward those with better fitness. This approach ensures that stronger solutions have a higher chance of passing their genes to the next generation, while still allowing weaker ones a chance to contribute, preserving diversity in the population."

A larger population provides greater diversity among candidate solutions, which enhances the algorithm's ability to explore the search space and avoid premature convergence to suboptimal solutions.\n",

        "With more individuals, the algorithm has a higher chance of discovering better-performing chromosomes, especially in complex or highly constrained problems like supply chain optimization. However, it's important to balance population size with computational cost, as larger populations require more processing time per generation."

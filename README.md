# Optimization Algorithms Repository

Welcome to this repository dedicated to a wide range of optimization problems and solution techniques. It serves as a curated collection of models, algorithms, and experiments focused on solving complex decision-making challenges in operations research and computational optimization.

## üìÇ Contents

This repository includes:

- **Unit Commitment Problem (UCP)**  
  Models and solvers for scheduling power generation units efficiently under operational constraints.

- **Linear Programming (LP)**  
  Formulations and solutions for deterministic optimization problems with linear constraints and objectives.

- **Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP)**  
  Advanced models involving both continuous and discrete decision variables.

- **Metaheuristic Algorithms**  
  Heuristic-based approaches such as Genetic Algorithms, Simulated Annealing, and Particle Swarm Optimization for tackling large-scale or non-convex problems.

- **Stochastic Optimization**  
  Techniques for modeling uncertainty in parameters, including scenario-based and probabilistic methods.
